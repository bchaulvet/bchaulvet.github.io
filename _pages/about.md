Hi, I'm Benoît. Welcome to my personal website. I'm a first year PhD candidate in Economics at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, at the Sorbonne Economic Center, under [Prof Maria Bas](https://sites.google.com/site/basmaria80/) & [Julien Wolfersberger](https://julienwolfersberger.fr/) supervisions.

Eager to better understand the world we are living in, my journey led me first on the path of business international trade and economics, which I studied throughout my education. On parallel, I started to develop my environmental awareness by realizing the impact our way of life on our planet.

This leads us to the PhD thesis on which I'm currently working. It aims to better understand the relationships between the way or societies interact with the environment and how we are affected by the consequences of climate change. 
- Natural Disasters and Firms Behaviors: I will focus on how firms are affected, but also adapt, to natural disasters in India.
- Geopolitics on Rare Resources: Here, I aim to help understand how Critical Raw Materials, essential for the Green Transition, are threatened by geopolitical tensions.
- Economic Development and Biodiversity: Taking a step back, this research regards how strucutal transformation affects biodiversity.
