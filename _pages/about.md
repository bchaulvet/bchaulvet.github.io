Hi, I'm Benoît. Welcome to my personal website. I'm a first year **PhD candidate in Economics** at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, at the Sorbonne Economic Center, under [Prof Maria Bas](https://sites.google.com/site/basmaria80/) & [Julien Wolfersberger](https://julienwolfersberger.fr/) supervisions.

Eager to better understand the world we are living in, my journey led me first on the path of business international trade and economics, which I studied throughout my education. In parallel, I started to develop my environmental awareness by realizing the impact our way of life has on our planet.  
This leads us to the PhD thesis I'm currently working on. It aims to better understand the relationships between the way our societies interact with the environment and how we are affected by the consequences of climate change.

- <span class="accent">Natural Disasters and Firms’ Behaviors:</span> How firms in India are affected by, and adapt to, natural disasters.
- <span class="accent">Geopolitical Tensions on Rare Resources:</span> Understanding how Critical Raw Materials essential for the green transition are threatened by geopolitical frictions.
- <span class="accent">Economic Development and Biodiversity:</span> How structural transformation over time influences biodiversity outcomes.
